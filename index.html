                <p> The <em><b><a href="post1.html">250 GTO </a></b></em> was designed to compete in Group 3 GT racing, where its rivals would include the Shelby Cobra, Jaguar E-Type and Aston Martin DP214.[16] The development of the 250 GTO was headed by
                    chief engineer Giotto Bizzarrini. Although Bizzarrini is usually credited as the designer of the 250 GTO, he and most other Ferrari engineers were fired in 1962 due to a dispute with Enzo Ferrari. Further development of the 250 GTO
                    was overseen by new engineer Mauro Forghieri, who worked with Scaglietti to continue development of the body.[5] The design of the car was a collaborative effort and cannot be ascribed to a single person.</p>

                <h2><a href="post2.html">JAGUAR E-TYPE</a></h2>
                <h5>Jaguar Feeber, jun 20, 2020</h5>
                <div class="bigimg" id="post2"></div>
                <p>Considered one of the most beautiful cars ever made. The Series 1 <em><b><a href="post2.html">Jaguar E-Type </a></b></em> was introduced, initially for export only, in March 1961. The domestic market launch came four months later in July
                    1961.[34] The cars at this time used the triple SU carburetted 3.8-litre six-cylinder Jaguar XK6 engine from the XK150S. Earlier built cars utilised external bonnet latches which required a tool to open and had a flat floor design.
                    These cars are rare and more valuable. After that, the floors were dished to provide more leg room and the twin bonnet latches moved to inside the car. The 3.8-litre engine was increased to 4.2 litres (4,235 cc) in October 1964.</p>

                <h5>Lets go Germany, Dec 7, 2019</h5>
                <div class="bigimg" id="post3"></div>
                <p>The <em><b><a href="post3.html">Porsche 911</a></b></em> traces its roots to sketches drawn by Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche in 1959.[7] The Porsche 911 was developed as a more powerful, larger and a more comfortable replacement for the 356,
                    the company's first model. The new car made its public debut at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show[8] (German: Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung).[9] The car was developed with the proof-of-concept twin-fan Type 745 flat-six engine,
                    but the car presented at the auto show had a non-operational mockup of the single-fan 901 engine, receiving a working unit in February 1964.[7]</p>
